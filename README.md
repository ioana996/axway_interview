1. The implementation of the DFS traversal is the iterative one. It is similar
to the BFS traversal but it uses a stack instead of a queue.

2. For the REST API I used Spring Boot Framework, a database created in
MySQL, MySQL Workbench as an IDE for the database and the Postman
application to test the CRUD functionality of the implementation.

3. The functionality of the Tree is a basic one. It is represented by a mapping
between each node and its list of children, just as in the inherited class 
Graph. Another mapping between the node and its parent is added using a HashMap
data structure. The methods implement the addition/removal of a node/children
or parent.

4. I implemented only the unit testing functionality using Maven tool.
